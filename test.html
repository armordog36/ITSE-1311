		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>My name is Gaushik. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Applied Technology degree in Software Development.</p>

		<p>I do not have much programming experience yet, but I am somewhat comfortable working with C++, Python, and HTML/JavaScript. I have strong skills in debugging, syntax structure, and problem-solving, which I believe will help me succeed in coding.</p>

		<h2>Why I Am Taking This Class</h2>
		<p>I am taking this class to build a strong foundation in web development and JavaScript. I want to understand how websites work behind the scenes and improve my ability to write clean, structured code.</p>

		<p>My goal is to grow my technical skills and become more confident in programming. I also hope this class helps prepare me for future coursework and real-world development projects.</p>
